BUG 001:
When testing summary. it sometimes shows random values. I was not able to resolve this issue.
I ran the program through gdb and didnt find aything. When I ran it through valgrind, I was 
presented with a lot of errors concerning "uninitialised values". It points to a function where
the values are indeed initialised, so I was not able to debug it further. 

BUG 002:
If the commands are not entered properly then the program exits with failure upon trying to access
elements in a vector that do not exit (because the command is parsed as a vector). This was left 
intentially as we were told in recitation that error checking the commands was not necessary.
