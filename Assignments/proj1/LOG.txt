  Developement Log: Assignment 1
  Name: Nathan Cazell

Sept 04, 2013: Draw out Class relation diagrams for classes Database, Play, and Parse.
Sept 05, 2013: Defined class attributes and functions. Began implementing some functions.
Sept 06, 2013: Wrote basic class functions and started main.cpp.
Sept 08, 2013: Starting parse file process. Learned how to implement vectors. Ran into some
               problems storing objects within vectors but figured out it was a simple syntax error.
Sept 09, 2013: Continued implementing Parse class. Wrote Explode() function for the PHP equivalent to
               in order to parse each comma delimited value in the file.
Sept 10, 2013: Essentially finished main.cpp driver program. Don't really need to change this one anymore.
Sept 11, 2013: Began implementing functions for Play class such a gets and sets and play query functions.
Sept 13, 2013: Implemented searching of Plays and setting type of play.
Sept 14, 2013: Wrote operations for summary command. Ran into problems with float values but changed
               to double type numbers and seemed to get rid of some problems. Still have issues with
               random values showing up in percentages.
Sept 16, 2013: Aqcuired help from Josh Lawrence grad student who came into the systems office today. Suggested I
               use valgrind and gdb to attempt to locate the source of the random numbers. Implemented List
               command and finished project.
