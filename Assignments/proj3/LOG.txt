  Name: Nathan Cazell

Oct 14, 2013: Defined and implemented the Doubly Linked List (Dll) class.
Oct 15, 2013: Converted the rest of the program to fit with the use of Dll class instead of vectors.
              Asked Srinivasan if I could use vectors for parsing the command. Answer was a big YES.
              Implemented Bubble Sort for Dll.
Oct 16, 2013: Finished implementing the Sort function and Move to Front function. Fixed Incorrect output.
