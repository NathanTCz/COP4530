BUG 001:
My program grabs one more similar play than the sample executable. I have
checked the algorithm and it seems to be fine.

BUG 002:
If the commands are not entered properly then the program exits with failure upon trying to access
elements in a vector that do not exit (because the command is parsed as a vector). This was left 
intentially as we were told in recitation that error checking the commands was not necessary.
